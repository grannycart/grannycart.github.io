The kid gripped a small light in his teeth and aimed it up under the van on the lift above his head; he squinted at a spot in the engine, then looked down and kicked an oil pan into place with his feet; he reached up and guided the wrench in his hand to the oil drain bolt with the bare greased-black finger pads of the other hand.

The old man sitting on the chair in the corner watched the kid work 'How long is that gonna take ya?'

The kid snapped the flashlight off and put it and the wrench in the pocket on the front of his apron "Fifteen minutes" the oil drain plug hit the oil pan below with a plink and a thick stream of oil poured down after it "drop the oil, change the filter, pour new oil in, effin easy".

'You young guys work to effin fast; my day we took our time, did the job right'.

"In my day, we do the job right without padding the hours all effin day and bilkin our effin customers" the kid spat and watch the oil drain.

'All I'm sayin is whats the effin rush'.

A boxy old mid-century boat pulled in front of the open garage door; a dead author of some regard rolled down the window ---Say, would it be possible to get my car looked at today?

The kid looked at the hood of the boxy mid-century car "What's wrong with it?"

---Can you not hear that knocking? Asked the dead author of some regard.

"I hear it; I just figured that's what an old boxy land-yacht like that sounds like".

'Ya dumb pree-sumchious kid; just cuz its old doesn't mean it would just naturally sound and run like sheet; why that ol' classic could-should be running like melting butter'.

---That's right; and I do care for it; I have put quite the pretty penny into it over the years. Said the dead author.

'Maybe you do. But, why do you sound so funny?' Asked the old man.

---Why, because I speak with an emdash.

'What in all that is effin grammatical is an emdash?'

---An emdash: a typographical mark equivalent to the width of a printed lowercase m; as opposed to an endash or a hyphen.

'Why the eff would you do that though?'

"Peoples got a right to speak the way they want".

---I do not disagree, but there's more to it than that. Really, I just do not see why we should adhere so rigidly to arbitrary rules of printing, grammar, spelling, or speech; there may be better ways to express the words of characters, possible ways that better capture the feeling of who the characters are, or even of human speech in general.

"Seems like it would make it difficult to know where a bit of dialog ends though".

---For a great writer, like myself, the dialog ends where the words make it feel like it ends. In almost all instances, you can figure out what is dialog and what is attribution or continuing action or description just by the context of the writing. Said the dead author, who had in the meantime stepped from his car, but now reached back in through the open window to retrieve a pack of cigarettes from between the seats; he knocked one from the pack, gripped it between his lips, and lit it.

'That's effin sheet! Why make it more work for a reader? Hard enough to get dumb-sheet people to read these days as it is without confusin em with ambiguous passages of dialog. In my day, we used single-quotes most of the time, and it served us just fine.'

"Pfft. Cept when your damn single-quote got mixed up with a plural possessive."

---My point is that it doesn't really matter. It's not _that_ much more work for the reader, I think virtually anyone is capable of following my writing.
