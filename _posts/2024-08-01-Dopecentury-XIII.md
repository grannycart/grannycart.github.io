Fetid water		Black and oily, light does not penetrate it		The water is all slick black surface	Turbid below, saturated with dissolved particles of decaying plant matter		A swimmer could touch the bottom, but would not want to
The bottom that could be touched is mud, many meters deep		A stone, a weight dropped in would sink right through the bottom, and continue sinking into the ever-thickening mud, maybe forever?		In places, bubbles rise up through the water, to pop with a slow cadence and small sound on the surface

Black trees, growing together in density		The trees grow up out of the black water		Wide roots like fat fingers that spread out for stability in the shallow water and the soft deep mud		The roots grow down as far as the limbs grow up, like a two-headed mushroom		Fungus, mosses, small leafy plants, and invertebrates cling to the roots of each tree		Above and below the waterline, each root is a community of the decrepit and slimy base of the food chain, waiting to be plucked off the roots to feed some larger and more significant creature		Without these sad communities, nothing would live here

So much lives here		long whipping snakes and fat crapulent snakes resting on the protruding roots of trees or hanging down from branches above		large flat turtles, mostly seen by a bump of a nose above the water surface		slimy fish that remain invisible in the black water until their lips suck down an insect from the water and leave behind spreading rings		alligator eyes --- always just the eyes		frog eyes, like miniature versions of the alligators		small mammals that paddle back and forth across the water leaving streaming Vs to mark their trail

Hermits living in isolated huts		Built up on stilts over the water		Rusting metal roof		Thin clapboard walls	A small dock of rotting wood out front		A small wooden boat tied up to the dock		desiccated fish drying on a rack		A cold lantern hanging from a roof corner		Smoke off a metal chimney pipe sits in the air above the hut without dispersing

In some places, hermit communities		Huts crammed in among the trees		Connected by walkways of wood that run back and forth just over the water		Nails in the boards the work their way up and catch the feet of people moving on the walkways

A small store in one corner of the hermit community		A porch out front with a slumping roof		People sitting on boxes and barrels and rickety chairs		Smoking and exhaling a haze that does not move out from under the porch		A rusting fanboat around back, loaded with boxes of cans to supply the store inventory

Sun streams down through the trees		Sun heats the black water		Vapor rises up from the surface and sits there		No breeze to move the mist		Damp air slips along slowly between the trees, moving by convection alone

The wet mist finds a path that leads through the swamp		A wider space carved by dredges		Still hemmed closely in by the black trees on either side		Follow the mist up the dredged way		It opens onto a place of oil derricks		Pumpjacks slowly rise and fall sucking oil up from below the swamp		Rusting iron tanks collect the oil		A nest of rotting greasy hoses connects the tanks to small barges		Flares burn off from steel towers that rise above the treeline		A dead turtle thumps against the hollow hull of the barge

A man on the store porch smokes his cigarette down to his fingertips		He leans back and flick his arm and the butt goes aflame as it flies		The butt lands in a patch of oil floating on the surface of the black water and ignites it		The flame spreads for a few meters and licks at the roots of one of the black trees		The roots char and blacken		The slimy communities of the fingerling roots flee
