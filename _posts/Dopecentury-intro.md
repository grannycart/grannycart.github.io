***This short fiction is part of Dopecentury, an experimental project where I try to channel the aural aesthetics of Dopesmoker into a written aesthetic. (Dopesmoker is the legendary stoner-doom metal masterpiece of which it is said: "the monotony rarely becomes tedious.") The experimental parameters are simply to listen to the hour-long single track of Dopesmoker while writing each of these "Dopecentury" entries. See the [Dopecentury project page](https://grannycart.net/dopecentury) for more details.***

[//]: # (Can this be done as an include file? So you can have one place to edit it for all dopecentury entires?)
