***This short fiction is part of Dopecentury, an experimental project where I try to channel the aural aesthetics of Dopesmoker into an aesthetic written in text. (Dopesmoker is the legendary stoner-doom metal masterpiece of which it is said: "the monotony rarely becomes tedious.") The rule: listen to the single hour-long track of Dopesmoker while writing each of these "Dopecentury" entries. (With little to no editing afterwards.) See the [Dopecentury project page](https://grannycart.net/dopecentury) for more details.***
