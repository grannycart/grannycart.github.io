_I put this question of Dopesmoker-aesthetic-in-written-prose-form to Chat GPT. Chat GPT did a great job of describing what made Dopesmoker special, I was honestly impressed.

This might seem like a good thing, but it wasn't because, once prompted to push a little on the Dopesmoker aesthetic, the texts it created were disturbingly similar to my own writing on this project. Right down to some of the same imagery I've used: bottomless holes of blackness and machines that tick as they cool. (Since the AI pulls those from statistical likelihood, does that mean those image are, by definition, clich√©?) Worse than that though was this sensation that I was myself falling down a bottomless hole: pushing the AI more and more just got me more results like something I might have written. The AI was perfectly capable of creating moments of quality, just like me. And also just like me, it seemed incapable of pushing past that to a new place --- that is, to something I haven't seen before. It made me feel like the AI and I were trapped, having a conversation where I expressed my desire to achieve something wholly unique and fascinating, and the AI just could not produces something that I wouldn't be able to produce myself. As if we are, in a way, stuck at the same level, when what we need is someone who can pull us up to a new level.
