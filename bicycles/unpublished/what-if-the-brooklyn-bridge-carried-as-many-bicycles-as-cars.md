The Brooklyn Bridge carries 150,000 cars per day.

Recent research shows that with the opening of the new bike path (a major win for the tourist pedestrians on the bridge, more so than for the cyclist down with the car exhaust) that consumed a Manhattan-bound lane of the bridge, the bridge is now carrying ~4000 bicycles a day. That is a big increase, something like 25% more bicycles, from before when bicycles had to share the pedestrian path.

But each lane of the bridge was previously carrying 25,000 cars per day (150,000 / 6 lanes). Assuming a single person per car (not an inappropriate assumption at all) the bicycle lane would need to be carrying 25,000 bicycles a day to make up for the loss of car traffic.

Let's imagine what 25,000 bicycle a day would be like. Unlike the car lanes, the bike lane goes in two directions, so to get a feel for the experience, you could reasonably divide the 25,000 number in half: say ~12,000 bicycles going in each direction on that one lane, in each 24 hour cycle. That would be a 6-fold increase from what we have right now: from ~2000 to ~12,000 bicycles.

6 times as many bicycles would be kind of a horror. It would be bicycle traffic akin to being on the 5 boroughs Bike Ride: where there are many, many points people are going so slowly that you have to stop and put your foot down and wait for the bicycle traffic to get moving again. This is mostly because of sheer volume of cyclists on the ride, not stoplights. If you think sitting in a car in traffic is awful, try standing around waiting for bicycle traffic to move. I'm sure people on electric bikes and road bikes are already annoyed at my own pokey conventional-bike pace. But standing at a dead stop is another frustration entirely.

Needless to say, this is hardly a vision of bicycle utopia.

It makes me realize that much of the pleasure of cycling around the city derives from the fact that most people DON'T. And if many more people did, it would become a hell not dissimilar from car traffic or being crunched on the subway. So in some ways, I'm inclined to beg you, the general public, to please NOT ride your bike, and save the pleasure for me.

But numbers are funny things and often don't give the whole picture. The 25,000 number per car lane doesn't represent cars zipping across the bridge (as bicycles currently do). The bridge really only gets to that volume because it has nearly the maximum capacity of cars crossing the bridge virtually 24 hours a day. Many a New Yorker has experienced sitting in crawling, no-apparent-cause traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge at 2 o'clock in the morning.

The bicycle lane carries traffic in a different pattern. It clumps around rush hour, but most of the night it has very, very low volume -- a few cyclists per hour in the middle of the night probably.

So to square things with the car capacity, the bicycle lane would have to start carrying 25,000 per day --- but with the density of that volume spread out over 24 hours. That starts to look like a busier bike lane that what we have now, but maybe not so busy as to cause completely stopped bicycle traffic. That's 500 bicycles per hour, or a little more than 8 bikes per minute (in both directions). A rate of traffic that is probably not very different than rush hour bicycle volume right now. (Hard to believe but each lane of the bridge is currently moving 1000 cars per hour, 24 hours day.)

It's undisputed that if the resources were committed to bicycle infrastructure that goes to cars (remember: the Brooklyn Bridge doesn't even carry commercial traffic) AND *everyone* road their bicycle, there would be no such thing as traffic.
