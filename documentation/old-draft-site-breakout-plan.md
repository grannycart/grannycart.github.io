# Old draft plan for site breakout
* [site breakouts](#breakout)
* [Sitemap (grannycart.net)](#sitemap)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Breakout of different sites:
:breakout:
I'm having such a hard time figuring out how to make the split between
what belongs in dynohub and what belongs in grannycart. Roughly, it
seems like dynohub should be personal/fun shit, and grannycart should
be professional shit about cities.. But what about things like the
bibliography? Where does that go? Some humor I think is good, which is
why grannycart should be my professional domain. I need to think about
grannycart in terms of: what would someone who wanted to hire me (to
write about cities? Or policy?) want to see in a portfolio/professional
site? Conceptually: stuff that would go to my professional email
address. While things that would be associated with dynohub email
address would go on dynohub.net. 


### dynohub.net
Use for all the other stuff that's NOT city-related that you are always
thinking about. Dig it out of germs. A good example: the bit you recently wrote
about people feeling unfulfilled for lack of mammoth to eat. NO POLITICS
though. Generally avoid the offensive and controversial, it should be fun
stuff!

* Think about the possibility of using physical space sense to map the site
	* Think about how visual and visceral putting your file system into a physical space feels, can you figure out a way to use that for organizing the site?
* Make cover page and link to bike racing graphic (it's own repo)
* maybe the gif you made for the bike lane (fun bike stuff is ok, though it will walk a close line for something city-oriented and should be in grannycart instead)
* ManoNSK graphic
* Move paraleipomenon over (it's own repo)
* design is evil?
* Mort Rye UFO stuff on medium? (pull from final versions on Medium)
* Grand jury (it's own repo? ...COULD still go in grannycart)
* A link to News For Xala
	* (though it probably should keep living on tumblr)
	* (include a link back to dynohub on github pages when you have it set up)
* Music for Emma (it's own repo)
	* Do another read through and check for errors against current version
	* Pretty sure this is already in a git repo of its own
* make germs into something postable?
	* Maybe a good way to frame these is as 'hypotheses':
		* instead of just submitting _critical_ perspectives
		* float hypothetical things that could be tested by other people.
		* Might be a good way to frame them as a positive, and keep the angry out
* Archive section:
	* To hold old art and music projects: link to Mort Rye/kill -9 stuff on you tube
* _posts
	* somehow turn germs into posts?
	* see commodity design: binder clips in germs (check out other design critique posts in germs too)
	* universal basic income:
		* Add idea to basic income post on dynohub: "Though let me be clear here: when I say "common sense" I don't mean some kind of folksy intuition. I'm talking about making basic logical arguments, rational critical thinking."
		* Consider removing your posting on UBI
			Eduardo Porter maybe covers it better than you do here:
				https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html
		* This also breaks my no-politics principle that I should establish for dynohub
* Consider: should dynohub be on github pages?
	* Yes, move dynohub.net to github pages:
		* I trust github to be around longer than tumblr
		* The working method is to have a local copy that also acts as a local backup/archive
		* newsforxala is the only thing with a following, and you are closing that out anyway
		* You do lose your small audience on tumblr, but it was hardly significant
		* Nobody looks for github blogs, so you would have to promote another way, like reposting on Medium, etc
		* figure out how to use dynohub for both dynohub and bib. Seems like it shouldn't be hard.
		* Figure out a custom theme so it looks unique, akin to the one on tumblr
		* It looks like github happily can take a unique domain name
	* Move your dynohub staging into vimwiki?
		* As a list of files you can click on with notes about them
		* combine in with germs


### grannycart.net
It is critical that you make building out grannycart a priority so you can
control your own narrative of your work on urbanism (and CUP).  Front the idea
that grannycart is a particular perspective on cities. (_My_ perspective ---
even if that's not fully articulated, perhaps it will become so the more work
you put up there and and framing to it. After all, your perspective is pretty
coherent. Also the beauty-of-grannycarts bit is not a bad place to start.)
Secondary should be the more look-what-I've-done parts of the work (CUP, etc).

The top of the site should be the grannycart (create some mini version at the
top of each page to always take you back up. Or just an arrow or whatever
works.) The tag line is the first thing you read: pushing home a cartload of
ideas (or whatever revisions of that). Then a small, short, two-sentence
paragraph about what the site is for, something like: A collection of ideas
about cities from the urbanist, me. (at little more in-depth than that,
but not much). Then the site is organized by the three categories below. (Think
about it from the perspective of a reader coming into the site: don't make them
work for what it holds, take their hand and lead them into it...)

Maybe _everything_ should live under grannycart, and your professional/city stuff
is a subdomain of grannycart? Then at the top level you have
categories (that maybe go to subdomains) like: cities.grannycart.net
crazyideas.grannycart.net etc. A subdomain to focus your professional/city work.

* The Knowable City
	* Intro topic: My profesional work has always been focussed on taking complexity and helping people under stand it.
		* (Steal back from linked in bio)
	* R project (it's own repo)
		* Upload your R script
		* Because why not
		* And it would show anyone looking for you that you can do a little R
	* resume (private repo)
	* coverletters (private repo)
	* AMI vs. MFI
	* Bibliography (it's own repo)
		* about.md
			* Might go on main page of bib repo
		* [Topic sub pages]
		* Disclaimer: Since what's included here is mostly unrealized or unfinished notes, sketches, frames, and germs of ideas it is possible (or indeed likely) that some of them are not fully researched, accurate, or politically correct. In addition, since I've been making notes on these subjects for more than a decade, any given opinion or notion may have been generated by my past self and does not necessarily reflect my current thinking.
		* Way to stash blank entries

* The Equitable City
	* Intro topic: While in other cities community groups might be little more than fronts for NIMBYs and crazies, in NYC they are a force to be reckoned with.
		* (Give a compelling narrative about how community groups are another layer of NYC govt; smart people with one foot in community's genuine needs) 
		* Social justice is part of making a city; and community groups (at least in NYC) are a good proxy for effective social justice
	* CUP work on social justice and with community groups
	* Map for Paula?
		* Ask Paula if it's ok for you to put this out public, as a demonstration of your GIS abilities. Should be, I think.
	* anything from that site paula and adrien built with resources for NYC communities?
	* Project you did for BSA job application?
	* Project you did for TNTP job application
	* letter to harper's	
	* both fiction and nonfiction
	* immigrants essay

* The Imagined City
	* Intro topic: Adam Curtis says we need to create imaginative new narratives for communities.
	* things that raise up underappreciated and undervalued aspects of cities
	* beauty of (literal) grannycarts introduction
	* rising filth essay
	* A Cannon for planners
	* Fresh Kills park stuff?
	* GIS stuff?
	* See 'essay prompt' in BSA job application --- might be something worth posting

* _posts
	* Not sure how a "blog" fits into the three categories broken down above
	* Pull from dynohub any essay that might fit the grimey city theme
		* This is an opportunity to review and revise them. 
		* Maybe take your time about this.
		* Include link to Harper's letter
	* Should also include fictions, even if partially finished.

* About page:
	* An explanation of who I am
	* maybe a more in-depth breakdown of the three categories above
	* licence: CC. Note that CUP work does not fall under this license.
* Under development
	* A section for ideas that are more baked than germs, but still half-baked
	* germs might go in the repo, but are left off github pages
	* After getting vetted to some degree they can go up half-finished in the development section

## Sitemap (grannycart.net)
:sitemap:
* [ ] index.md
	* [ ] Set up favicon
		* some kinda of mini-cart icon?
	* [ ] Add dynohub logo graphic to top of page(s?) Or grannycart logo?
		* Figure out if this goes on every page
		* Or maybe just the flat sturmey graphic (which you have to get somewhere)
		* Or some other option
		* See if you have a good grannycart graphic (and favicon)
			* Should it (can it) be on the side of the page?
* [ ] about.md
	* [Hopefully, grannycart can hold all non-pro work. And hopefully be somewhat coherent about it.] 
		* NO random-topic posts with no background explanation.
		* Every project or topic needs to be in a section with an intro that creates a path into it that makes sense to an general audience
			* Do NOT make the mistake of so many blogs that assume your audience just KNOWS so many of the same things you do.
	* Not a shiny new grannycart, a rusty old one. Perhaps left next to a stoop, secured to the rail by a light piece of chain and a padlock
	* These carts are ubiquitous tools of dense urban cores. The fact that they fold means they can be stored in small apartments. But the magic is in just how much stuff you can fit into an open-topped cart of that particular shape --- and still roll it on and off the subway or bus.
	* I love these things. I love the function of them. But more I love the aesthetic of them.
	* I'm me, and I am a generalist, interested in such a variety of things. (Pull list from personal profiles)
	* I feel guilty, in many ways, for pulling only the best stuff off the top of any genre or topic. The luxury of doing this is afforded to me because that best stuff rests on top of the mind-numbingly dull work of the obsessed and nerdy. I feel guilty because I sometimes feel like I only take, and I don't give back in this process. I feel like I should be obsessed with at least one subject, and digesting it and representing it for others who skim the cream off the top of subjects.
	* Disclaimer: Since what's included here is mostly unrealized or unfinished notes, sketches, frames, and germs of ideas it is possible (or indeed likely) that some of them are not fully researched, accurate, or politically correct. In addition, since I've been making notes on these subjects for more than a decade, any given opinion or notion may have been generated by my past self and does not necessarily reflect my current thinking.
	* Link to Linked in for my professional work
		* CUP work (static page on main repo, with all external links)
* [ ] A section about your views on empiricism and science
	* Empirical knowledge is like Democracy: it's the worst method we have for understanding the world except for all the rest
	* It seems likely that the act of measuring the world changes it (thus: placebo affect)
	* For this reason I now believe fictions are more powerful than empirical evidence
* [ ] Love the Grimey city (it's own repo? Or is this the MAIN content?)
	* [The idea of this repo is a rough place to put all things in this idea, so that maybe I could pull something coherent out of it eventually.]
* [ ] about.md
	* I think this is how I ended up interested in cities. Cities encompass so _much_ in a way that is almost magical: health, economics, built space, social justice and human rights, art, design, transportation, network effects, culture, religion, immigration, and human beings in all their most quirky and culturally rich versions of themselves.
	* Because of the wide range of subjects, cities became one pole of my interest. But the other remained a fascination with a certain kind of aesthetic. One based on a grungy, dirty, noisyness. I love the aesthetics of really grimey heavy metal.
		* Why, I ask myself, can I not have that aesthetic in a city? 
	* But in delving into the fields that ostensibly shape cities: planning, architecture, real estate, design; I found that the aesthetics of these fields are extremely limited. They seemed to be trapped in some mid-century notion of what a modern city should look like, how it should function, and who should be in power. 
		* Even advocates for social justice (while having better ideas about who should be in power) often seemed to find themselves backing some plan or other for a 'cleaner,' 'more efficient,' city. In this age where everyone travels, apparently everyone wants their city to look like a European city. Not me.
		* This exposes a certain naivete of people who have the power to shape cities. Europeans and Japanese might be on board culturally for clean, high-tech cities. But Americans are different. Grime (and to some extent violence) are a part of us. Those in power can continually try to shut it down, but it it pops up over and over again, like whack-a-mole because it is a _fundamental_ part of our culture, even if not of every individual person.
	* This ties to a notion that has been going around for a while: that it was in some ways better "in the bad old days." And in many ways I am sympathetic to this: I believe the most _beautiful_ of all cities, in any time, was NYC in the 1970s. 
		* People say "we don't want to go to the bad old days, but..."
		* I say we _do_ want to go to the bad old days. They were never really that bad. This is not to romanticize the violence of the 1970s --- there is nothing that should be preserved about living in fear in the city, but some sense of _danger_ living in a city is something that makes you feel like you belong when you overcome it (and also helps keep the rich people out).
	* The only person, fictional or real, who seems to be defending this aesthetic of cities is Carol Kane's Lilian character on Unbreakable Kimmy Scmidt. But it's played for laughs. The grimey city is also a serious thing.
	* What's on this site: 
		* I've been thinking about these ideas for a long time, but have not been able to convert them into some coherent final product. This site is not final product. It's a lot of ideas along these lines, roughed out, but not polished for public consumption. It's merely the fact that github pages makes it so easy to convert all this process stuff into a publicly accessible form that even tempts me to put it up. That, and my fear that like Mr. Casaubon's great book in Middlemarch, maybe all I have is piles of notes and I may never be able to create a final product, or perhaps it isn't even something that can _be_ created.
		* Disclaimer: Since what's included here is mostly unrealized or unfinished notes, sketches, frames, and germs of ideas it is possible (or indeed likely) that some of them are not fully researched, accurate, or politically correct.
