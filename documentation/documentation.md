# Grannycart.net notes and documentation
* [to dos](#todos)
* [Github Pages Tech Notes](github-pages-tech-Notes)
* [Old draft site breakout plan](old-draft-site-breakout-plan)
* [Github Pages Tech Notes: things that didn't work](tech-notes_didnt-work)


## Things to do
:todos:
* [X] does the directory structure go in the root dir? or in _data?
	* directory structure goes in the root dir, only the menu.yml (index.md content) config goes in _data
	* if you forget, just look at the about page structure
* [ ] move how bicycle racing works from dynohub to grannycart
* [ ] write up documentation based on what things look like on the web page vs where they actually are in the file structure
* [ ] After you get grannycart setup; set the account to be an "available for hire" account (in settings)
* [ ] When you finally have a working site, clean up (or simply delete) all the previous commits
* [X] set up a real domain name
	* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages
	* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain
* [ ] set up favicon
	* I did one pass at setting this up, but it looks terrible
	* try doing a version where you just fill in the form of the cart as a solid. Might read OK small.
* [ ] enable https? (It's a setting on github somewhere, I think.)
* [ ] google analytics or goatcounter?
	* Check out goatcounter
* [ ] experiment with building locally
	* See notes below
	* This can be done in a branch, so the _site dir and files won't be in the master
* [ ] Consider changing the spacing on the headers
	* I believe this is the em adjustments in _sass
* [ ] Change yellow highlights for footnotes
	* See example posts from maintainer
* [ ] Experiment with smaller font sizes
	* See notes in fonts below
* [ ] figure out how sub-pages link back to top of subdir, and then to top of site
