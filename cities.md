## My work at the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)

### Books:
These are illustrated guidebooks that break down complex land-use issues affecting community members. I co-wrote, edited, and produced these books of around 150 pages each.
* [What Is Zoning?](http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=64) <img height="100" src="http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0003/2482/what_is_zoning_book_side_519.jpg">
	* Shows how zoning shapes neighborhoods, blocks, and buildings in NYC.
* [What Is ULURP?](http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=203) <img width="100" src="http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0009/2619/guidebook-3d-2_433.jpg">
