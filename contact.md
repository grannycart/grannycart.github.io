# Contact me / sign up for the mailing list

You can use this page to contact me, or to be added to my email mailing
list. I encourage you to sign up for the mailing list. There will be no
spam. There will be very little email at all. Mostly it's a way for me
to make sure the people who are most interested in my work know about
new stuff when it becomes available. I wrote a whole thing about <a href ="https://grannycart.net/junk-drawer/mailing-list">why you should support creative work by signing up for email lists</a>. 
But I'll spare you from that here.
