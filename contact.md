# Contact me / sign up for the mailing list

I encourage you to sign up for the mailing list. There will be no
spam. There will be very little email at all. Mostly it's a way for me
to make sure the people who are most interested in my work know about
new stuff when it becomes available. If you need more convincing, 
I wrote a whole thing about 
[why you should support creative work by signing up for email lists](https://grannycart.net/junk-drawer/mailing-list). 

If you just want to send me a message, I'll be happy to respond!
