My name is Mark Torrey. I'm a writer, visual critic,apologist for gritty
cities, and general doubter of cultural and systemic hegemony. 

* [On submarines](https://grannycart.net/subworld-pages/): An untitled novel with some submarines in it. Also a pigeon.
* [On cities](cities/cities.md): The subject closest to my heart.
* [The Junk Drawer](junk-drawer/junk-drawer.md): All the other garbage I have made.
