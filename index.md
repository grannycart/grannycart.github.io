## Who made this stuff?
My name is Mark Torrey. I'm a writer, urban apologist, visual critic,
and general doubter of cultural and systemic hegemony. 

## How did you put these 3 random categories together?
At first, I wasn't sure myself. These were the biggest categories
covering the subjects of things I had written or created. But why
cities, submarines, and bicycles? It seems that if you take all the
inputs that go into me, get processed, and then get churned back out,
these are the categories you end up with.

What inputs? Well, this is a bibliography of everything I've read in
the last bunch of years that I thought was significant enough that
I might want to refer back to it later:
* My inputs -> [Bibliography](http://grannycart.net/bibliography/)
It's not a perfect system, but I began to categorize the articles and
books I was reading. The categories I ended up with in my bibliography
were: Urbanism, Housing, ULURP, Zoning, Transportation, Sport, Health,
Music, Art, Criticality, Politics (And Public Policy), Humanity,
Science, Economics, Other Stuff, and Novels.

After running all that information through the machine that is me,
I ended up creating most projects and writings in the categories of
cities (or urbanism), bicycles, and submarines. I actively resist the
temptation to write about politics (and by extension economics,
health, and --- in most cases --- science). I guess that left me with
my outputs in those 3 categories. If you think about each of them more
abstractly, you might come up with something like this:
* My outputs ->
	* Submarines: They are really dream objects. You almost never
	see one, but they are out there in the ocean all the time,
	huge and looming and black. They represent the pinnacle of
	human technology, and the ability for humans to live --- these
	days nearly indefinitely --- in an environment that is hostile
	without remorse to human life. The exist almost entirely
	beneath the surface of consciousness, passing silently below.
	* Bicycles: They are the simplest of human technologies, yet scientists
	struggle to explain how they work. There's a kind of magic to
	them. They are a negative-space-of-physics object --- the
	bicycle has always existed as a function of how our basic
	physics work. Its form that was never invented, it was
	_discovered_. It has a very special relationship with cities.
	* Cities: They are the greatest collective art project of
	humankind. Though they are kinetic works that are never done
	and continually evolving. To some they are engines of economy.
	To others they are enormous sculptural objects. To others they
	are focal points of magic, where the ley lines of human
	culture come together. To most of us, they are home.
I think that somewhere there is a nexus between these three things,
and my subconscious found it already, while my conscious writing still
struggles to unearth exactly how it comes together.
