[//]: # (Grid explanation: The pipe-colon-hashes-colon-pipes line tells github to center align column content because of the colons on both sides. In the square brackets is a bit of html that gives the image with in pixels, alt text, and source image. In the reguaral parenthese following the square bracket is where you go if you click on the image in the square bracket. The BR in angle brackets gives you a newline, but only when converting to html. Following that is text displayed next to the image. The pipe separates item in that row of the grid.)

## I wrote, art-directed, and edited these projects (still need to fill in)
