# Possible future entries:
* (see daydreams)
    * cliffside mining machines
    * space laser gun guidance pod
    * huge cargo submarine docking facility with sub tugs
* solo-operator submarine failure
    * the sounds of the tanks failing, descending
    * writing a final note: I am still in love with you
* Jack Bauer style internal dialog
    * Pulling race radio out of his ear
    * "Time! time! give me the time!"
    * maybe one long paragraph, which is how a bike race feels, and also since it would all be in his head
* rules of the smug god
* ~~sonic titan: a huge sound that travels across the lanscape~~
    * Sonic Titan II: One huge sound travels across the landscape to do battle with a second that comes to meet it. 
        * They need to have distinctive sounds, distinctive weapons.
        * People running around on the ground, kaiju style
        * a dude shits his pants (from fear, or the sound, or both)
* something about a machine that runs on for hours with unconscious people aboard before crashing
    * Based on the golfer Payne Steward Learjet crash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_South_Dakota_Learjet_crash
* a paleolithic father and daughter walk barefoot across a muddy landscape full of mammoths, sloths, and saber-toothed monster. They are starving and heard that a group nearby had secured a large pile of meat.
    * possibly good for the phonetics experiment
        * make a list of phonetic elements that can be used, derived from dopecentury X
    * pick up where dopecentury X left off, and continue the story in a later Dopecentury entry
* experiment with syntax:
    * run-on sentences, whole paragraph sentences.
    * grammaer
    * alternative punctuation
    * "building blocks" --- write a bunch of short bits (maybe even just a couple of words) that could be strung together in a different order later.
* Something based on the killdozer
* A town in a hollow wakes up to find themselves engulfed in smoke. Wet shirts over mouths hand in hand they make their way through mud to get above the smoke. The smoke does not go
* A belt of mountains of fat (fatbergs) circle the waist of the globe. Machines cut it, push it, suck it, and burn it.
* A series of text messages from people aboard a crashing plane, sending their last messages:
    * peppered with the typical "I love you honey, and the kids"
    * But also a report from a pilot sitting in the jump seat: thrust reversers deployed at crusiing speed. Hope this report helps your investigation
        * (this helps tell the story with no other explanation of what is going on)
    * a heavy metal fan: "I die in battle! I go to valhaalla!"
    * Some religious notes. Maybe some repentances
    * "The ambition, audacity, and hubrid of humans! to fly through the air. And who pays the price for that hubris? Me? The innocents on board this flight?"
    * "Safest way to fly my ass!"
    * as an experiement in discipline, type all entries on the flip phone with T9
* A world where _everyone_ lives in their own microstate
* Somehow do a version of the natural appeal of mechanical things (mice on wheels)
* loud bars to prevent revolutions
* A version of the story where a boy lifts a calf until it's a man lifting a bull (see Faulkner Intruder in the Dust)
* A soliloquy where you debate with yourself the merits of plunging into icy cold water
