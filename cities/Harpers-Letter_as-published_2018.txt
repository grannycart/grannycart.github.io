Death and Taxes

Kevin Baker’s essay about New York is a comprehensive catalogue of the symptoms of overdevelopment affecting the city today [“The Death of a Once Great City,” Report, July]. But like many other commentators, he reduces the causes from a set of complex capitalist forces down to a problem of individuals and real estate, and offers only adjustments to public policy as a solution.

The situation in New York is not unprecedented in history (except perhaps for the sheer scale). From that history, we know that policy tinkering generally yields marginal results. However, we also know that there are moments of crisis in which we have an opportunity to apply the forces of regulation and restraint. Perhaps the rows of empty apartments and condominiums Baker describes are a sign of impending turbulence. We must be ready this time to take action.
