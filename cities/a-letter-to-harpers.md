## A Letter I Submitted to Harper's Magazine 

The subject of why and how rich people are ruining NYC, and what can be
done about it, has become a perennial favorite of the long-form article
class. In 2018 Kevin Baker took a pass at it in Harper's Magazine:
https://harpers.org/archive/2018/07/the-death-of-new-york-city-gentrification/

Since I know a thing or two about cities, and about NYC in particular,
I thought I should stage dive into the mosh pit on this one. I felt
like Baker had succumbed to the overly-simplified explanations of and
solutions to gentrification proffered by those who believe the systemic
malfeasance of the world is driven more by failings of markets and
public policy than by the larger cultural forces of global capital.
I wrote a response letter to Harper's Magazine expounding on this
criticism, which they duly published.

To be fair to Baker, it's a bit of a cheap shot on my part to claim
that problems of gentrification are far too complex to address with a
few policy tweaks. Of *course* they are. It just bugs me when they are not
framed that way. Yes, let's try messing with local housing policy ---
how can we not? But let's not kid ourselves by pretending policy changes
will spur rich people to make space for all classes and cultures in our
city. The rich people just love the city *too* much now. They want the
whole thing to themselves. We need bigger solutions to this big problem.

I guess the editors of Harper's saw some merit to my point, but perhaps
felt I wasn't being quite concise enough about it. They heavily edited
what I submitted to them. Here's my letter, as published:
https://harpers.org/archive/2018/09/letters-september-2018/

And here's the letter as I submitted it. (I have no say as to which
version is superior):

_Kevin Baker's July 2018 article about NYC is a lovely catalog of the
symptoms of the disease affecting NYC today. But like many other people,
he reduces a complex set of capitalist forces down to the individual
problem of real estate; and offers only tinkering with public policy as
a solution._

_The disease is not a disease of NYC alone - it affects all our global
cities. And it is not caused by the value of real estate alone, it is
combined with the forces of inequitable economic development, free
trade, deregulation, unrepresentative democracies that over-empower
rural areas, and just the fad that it's cool to live in cities these
days, among a host of other issues. And while the causes of NYC's
disease are complex, they are not unprecedented in history (except
perhaps for the sheer scale)._

_What history teaches us is that policy tinkering generally yields
marginal results (not that we shouldn't tinker, we definitely should).
But history also teaches us that the teetering and fragile (and
mind-numbingly dull) monstrosities that capitalism creates will
eventually collapse back on themselves - and it is at that moment that
we should seize the opportunity to apply forces of regulation and
restraint. It is possible that this empty warehousing of units that even
the mega-wealthy are unable to afford is one of the first signs that a
collapse like this will be upon us soon. We must be ready for action._
