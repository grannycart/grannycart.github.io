## My work at the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)
(Much of this work has disappeard from the CUP website since it was redesigned. Hence the links to the Internet Archive. [Support Internet Archive's work!](https://archive.org/donate))

### Books:
These are illustrated guidebooks that break down complex land-use issues affecting community members. I co-wrote, edited, and produced these books of around 150 pages each.
* [What Is Zoning?](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=64) <img height="100" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0003/2482/what_is_zoning_book_side_519.jpg">
	* Shows how zoning shapes neighborhoods, blocks, and buildings in NYC.
* [What Is ULURP?](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=203) <img width="100" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0009/2619/guidebook-3d-2_433.jpg">
	* Explains how NYC's land-use review process (ULURP) requires input from every level of city government.
* [What Is Affordable Housing? (NYC edition)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=16) <img height="100" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0003/3593/what_is_affordable_housing_profile_520.jpg">
	* Lays out how affordable housing programs target different income levels, raising the perennial question: affordable for whom?
* [What Is Affordable Housing? (Chicago edition)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/Store?product_id=112) <img height="100" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220121000335/http://welcometocup.org/image_columns/0006/4517/cup_campo_de_los_impustos_1copy-01_518.png">
	* Once you understand how affordable housing works in NYC, you might want to check out Chicago as well.

### Fold-out Posters:
These projects in CUP's Making Policy Public (MPP) program cover a wide variety of social justice issues. I wrote, edited, and art-directed these pamphelts that fold out to large posters. (Roughly 2500 words each, plus graphics.)
