## NYC rezoning map
* Created for a unique rezoning initiated in the Two-Bridges neighborhood. This rezoning was initiated by local community organizations with limited resources. I volunteered to create and update maps required by the Department of City Planning. Virtually every detail of this map was set to meet DCP's requirements specifications for rezoning maps.

## Research maps of Chicago
* An analysis of MFI by community area in Chicago. These were maps for research purposes, not publication.

## Sub-borough maps of NYC
* A sub-borough area/PUMA map of NYC included in CUP's Affordable Housing Toolkit. I laid out the map layers in QGIS, and worked with designer [Manuel Miranda](http://www.manuelmiranda.info/) to create a polished final version.

* I also worked with a developer to update the data in CUP's interactive map that shows incomes in NYC relative to housing subsidy targets in each sub-borough area.

## NYC Garbage infrastructure scaled to the size of Fresh Kills Park
* At the request of an artist, I used GIS to calculate points if all of NYC's garbage infrastructure sites were scaled down to fit in the space of Fresh Kills Park in Staten Island.

## R script to calculate median incomes
* I put together a simple R script to calculate median incomes from abitrary Census geographies.

## Maps for a landscape architecture studio
* A little designy-ier, a little more unconventional, a little more polished. All are visions for a development site in Philadelphia.
