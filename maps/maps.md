## NYC rezoning maps
Created for a unique rezoning initiated in the Two-Bridges neighborhood. This rezoning was initiated by local community organizations with limited resources. I volunteered to create and update maps required by the Department of City Planning.

## Research maps of Chicago
An analysis of MFI by community area in Chicago. These were maps for research purposes, not publication. 

## R script to calculate MFI
A simple R script I wrote to use linear interpolation to calculate Median Family Income of Chicago community areas.

## Research maps of NYC
An analysis of MFI by sub-borough area/PUMA in NYC. These were maps for research purposes, not publication.

## Maps I did for a landscape architecture studio
A little designy-ier, a little fancier, maybe a little less clear.
